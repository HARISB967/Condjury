# Condjury
The Condorcet jury game models the decision-making process of a jury tasked with 
determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant. Each juror receives a signal about the defendant's 
guilt, which may be accurate or inaccurate to varying degrees. Jurors must weigh their own signal 
against the signals of their peers to arrive at a verdict. This game captures the inherent uncertainty 
and complexity of jury decision-making, where imperfect information and individual biases influence 
the final outcome.
